XCRI-CAP with KIS - Demonstrator project
========================================

Extending XCRI-CAP with KIS data
--------------------------------

This repository contains the example code and components for the 'Extending XCRI-CAP with KIS data' project.

The project investigated joining up the XCRI-CAP and KIS data sets to provide meaningful and practical outputs. Specifically, it links an XCRI-CAP course data set to its relevant KIS data set and uses the combined super-set as a basis for an enhanced course search. It also adds KIS elements to an XCRI-CAP file to produce a combined extended/'value-add' feed.

You can try out the 'XCRI-CAP with KIS' course search on the [Demonstrator web page](http://kis.igsl.co.uk/kis/ "XCRI-CAP with KIS course search demonstrator"). Start by entering a Course Title search topic (which searches against XCRI-CAP data) and optionally an 'Assessment by coursework' or 'Work/Study six months after finishing the course' parameter (which search against KIS data). The demonstrator then uses the [XXP](http://www.xxp.org/ "XXP server") server to return a list of matching courses. Click on a course ID to see the combined XCRI-CAP and KIS course details.
